# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - SpaceX Guided Project

The objective of this guided project is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The business objective is from the perspective of a SpaceX competitor: Spacex advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This guided project from the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) provided a taste of how data scientists work with real datasets. Assuming the role of a data scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, this guided project walks through the data science methodology:
- Data collection
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization 
- Model development 
- Model evaluation
- Reporting of results to stakeholders

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks in Watson Studio 

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.
